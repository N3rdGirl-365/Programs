I wrote a lot of the foundationalcode and worked to keep it up to date throughout the project. 
My code is the csv fle which reads in the stock notifications I made.
The buttons and bulding a stage were some of the hardest parts. I had to make them have the right response to a click, 
where it would change dimensions and change text.
Then I had make everything readable
Then we found out if needed to be mor object oriented, which I admit was very helpful. We should have dibe that from the beginning
Instead of 5 different button codes, we had 1 that worked with everything.
